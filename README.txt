Encompassing v1.0pre1
---------------------
Lua HUD for Aleph One
by Hopper

A straightforward HUD with only a few images, and a compass for OpenGL
users.

Install:

1. Place the directory "Encompassing" inside the "Textures" directory in
   your Aleph One application directory. (Unix users should look in
   /usr/local/share/AlephOne instead.) If you don't have a "Textures"
   directory already, create it.
   
2. Place the script "Encompassing.lua" wherever you like. Your Aleph One
   preferences directory would be a good place.

3. Launch Aleph One (0.22pre2), and go to "Preferences", then "Environment".

   3a. Check the box "Use HUD Script".
   
   3b. Next to "Script File", click the words "(no valid selection)" to
       open a file dialog. Navigate to the directory where you saved
       Encompassing.lua, and select it by double-clicking its name.

   3c. Click "Accept", then "Return" to exit the preferences.

4. You're all set now; go create some carnage.
